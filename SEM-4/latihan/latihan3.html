    <h1>Welcome to Muhammad Labib's Beverage Page</h1>
    <p>
        Hi there! I'm Muhammad Labib, a beverage enthusiast and i'm not a barista. 
        But i love exploring different types of beverages, like <i>coffee and matcha</i>. 
        On this page, I'll share my favorite recipes, tips for brewing the perfect cup, and my thoughts on the latest trends in the beverage world.

    <h2>How i make an improvement from an instant coffee to a ridiculous cup of coffee</h2>
    <p>Before making improvements, I used to rely on instant coffee. Here are the steps I took to elevate my coffee game:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Step 1: Choose Instant coffee that you have</strong> - I started by selecting high-quality instant coffee. This made a significant difference in flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 2: Use Fresh, Filtered Water</strong> - I switched to using fresh, filtered water instead of tap water. This improved the taste and aroma of my coffee.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 3: Use the Right Water Temperature</strong> - I learned that the ideal water temperature for brewing coffee is between 85°C and 92°C. This helps extract the best flavors from the coffee.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 4: Pay Attention to Ratios</strong> - I started measuring my coffee-to-water ratio to ensure consistency in every cup. A common ratio is 1:7 (1 gram of instant coffee to 7 grams of water).</li>
        <li><strong>Step 5: Experiment with Additions</strong> - I began experimenting with different additions like milk, cream, sugar, or flavored syrups to enhance the taste of my coffee.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Now we are talking about matcha</h2>
    <p>Before making improvements, I used to rely on instant coffee. Here are the steps I took to elevate my coffee game:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Step 1: Choose High-Quality Matcha</strong> - I started by selecting high-quality matcha powder. This made a significant difference in flavor and texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 2: Use Fresh, Filtered Water</strong> - I switched to using fresh, filtered water instead of tap water. This improved the taste and aroma of my matcha.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 3: Use the Right Water Temperature</strong> - I learned that the ideal water temperature for preparing matcha is between 70°C and 80°C. This helps preserve the delicate flavors and prevents bitterness.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 4: Use a Proper Matcha Bowl and Whisk</strong> - I invested in a traditional matcha bowl (chawan) and a bamboo whisk (chasen) to ensure proper preparation.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 5: Sift the Matcha Powder</strong> - I began sifting the matcha powder before preparing it to avoid clumps and ensure a smooth texture.</li>
    </ul>
